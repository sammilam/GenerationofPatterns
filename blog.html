        <h1> Pattern Blog </h1>
        <div class="description">
            <p> This blog comprises journal entries based on my experience with everyday patterns. My thesis hopes
                to
                investigate the psychological affinity and emotional effects of patterns on humans. By doing so, I
                use
                psychological strategies such as attention and emotional theories, Cannon-Bard and James Lange's.
                <br>
                <br>
                This consistent repetition of photographing, sketching, and reflecting allowed me to discover
                alternative
                ways to look at patterns and myself. This process interests different perspectives we superimpose on
                designed artifacts and how creating/selecting describes us. As such, design is a cycle of
                repetition,
                like
                patterns.

                <p> So many swirls that makes it busy looking
                    The colour brown or beige makes it dull why?
                    Maybe it’s because of the same tone that is not contrasting enough.
                    The dark versus light shades are different.
                    The swirls fill up the space, making it overstimulated.
                    I feel my energy spread throughout the chest area.
                    A swirly florally like pattern of vines in brown and beige combo similar to ink blotches
                    I feel this tension within my chest.
                    Anxious, lost on where to look.
                    I feel my eyes going up and down.
                    The little details of the brush makes me feel super itchy.
                    It seems outdated and ancient. It captures the maximalist carpet look.
