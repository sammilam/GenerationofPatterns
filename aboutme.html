                <!-- Separated profile from title -->
                <p>I’ve always admired patterns. Visually, they are captivating—one motif repeating
                    itself across a surface, creating harmony and rhythm. Designing patterns can be deceptively simple:
                    a single square repeated to form something greater. Patterns are everywhere, embedded in our
                    surroundings and behaviour. Humans instinctively connect the dots, using patterns to process
                    information, navigate challenges, and create meaning.
                    <br><br>
                    But why do we like patterns? Perhaps they bring a sense of order and organization, offering
                    familiarity and comfort. Repetition allows us to move through life effortlessly, building a
                    foundation for new opportunities. Yet, patterns are not always beneficial. History, too, repeats
                    itself—sometimes with devastating consequences. As the Earth warms and conflicts persist, we find
                    ourselves trapped in cycles of chaos.
                    <br><br>
                    How might patterns offer a perspective? An element of surprise? What is seen normal that probably
                    should not be overlooked? Our design process mirrors life: research, repeat, and restate. By
                    studying and understanding our experiences, we can disrupt harmful patterns and create meaningful
                    change. Patterns, while often seen as static, hold the potential to inspire growth, transformation,
                    and unlimited possibilities.

            <p class="intro">
                In case you weren't there, I hosted a raffle during our Fall Semester term exhibition. I have built a
                website documenting my daily generative art inspired by my strongest emotion per day. I hoped to take
                this opportunity to survey the public and collect opinions on the relationship between mood and
                patterns. I thought of a main component. An “infinite scroll” of patterns in a rolodex to project
                live changes. This was a physical depiction of what I intended to code for my final website. An
                abandoned website can be found here!

                <br> <br>
                In the end, it is a current artifact signifying the past work I have done. It took a lot of manual
                labour to cut, glue, and assemble the cards. I thought the process of repetition was ironic to the
                idea of patterns. Additionally, the collected results turned into my book: Pattern Profiles. If you have
                entered the
                raffle, please check out your pattern! I thought it would be fun to see everyone's patterns in a book.

                A lot of the work displayed for GradEx was a collective effort with my friends. I am so grateful for
                their help and support. I could not have done it without them! Below is the behind the scenes of the
                production to date.<br> <br>
