            <p> This blog comprises journal entries based on my experience with everyday patterns. My thesis hopes
                to
                investigate the psychological affinity and emotional effects of patterns on humans. By doing so, I
                use
                psychological strategies such as attention and emotional theories, Cannon-Bard and James Lange's.
                <br>
                <br>
                This consistent repetition of photographing, sketching, and reflecting allowed me to discover
                alternative
                ways to look at patterns and myself. This process interests different perspectives we superimpose on
                designed artifacts and how creating/selecting describes us. As such, design is a cycle of
                repetition,
                like
                patterns.

            <p>So many swirls that makes it busy looking.
                The colour brown or beige makes it dull. Why?
                Maybe it’s because of the same tone that is not contrasting enough. The dark versus light shades are
                different. The swirls fill up the space, making it overstimulated. Feels my energy spread throughout
                the
                chest area. A swirly florally like pattern of vines in brown and beige combo similar to ink
                blotches. I
                feel this tension within my chest. Anxious, lost on where to look. I feel my eyes going up and down.
                The
                little details of the brush makes me feel super itchy. It seems outdated and ancient. It captures

                my room where I sleep? Breathable with white space to digest. Feelings come from the head. Focus is on
                one spot which is at the flowers. I feel warmth within the colours. My eye changes, hopping around from
                one place to another. I feel an unfolding sensation, the water colours send a chilling feeling. I find
                the water colours to be relaxing and raw in nature. It is authentic and incomplete but the texture and

            <p>Mesmerized by the spacing and contrast in the pattern. I zone out within the space. I felt calm and
                centered, looking at the middle. Almost like I am contained and united in this circle and grid
                structure. The colour was brown and beige, giving a warm and cozy sensation. It is a flat 2D surface,
                with nothing more to look into, like a wall.

                Walking into the Chinese buffet, I felt my energy at low. The atmosphere of the location did not excite
                my anticipation for food. It was a dull and outdated design that is darkly lit, almost abandoned. The
                strokes on the wood interlocking with different shades of brown resembles burnt firewood. Captured this
                pattern within my position. It establishes a cultural touch with Chinese heritage. Red is an important
                colour for luck and prosperity. The wooden materiality, I would assume, has a raw authenticity of
                China’s upbringing. The random strokes of lines caught me off guard. While the wooden logs are organized
                in a grid, its contents add a layer of texture. I feel a bit conflicted. My eyes move up, right, down,
                left. Looping in a circle. Disrupting flow to shift in different directions. Mismatched coloration,
                random holes. As a whole, it intrigues my mind. A pattern is ordered but the wood’s graining is
                randomized. The holes, I wonder what are they for? But their addition led me to feel like I’m going in
                circles. Like I am stuck in a loop, with these little holes that will soon turn into bigger problems.
                Unstable was the feeling. </p>

                Walking in, I felt welcomed and enticed with the space. These repeated floor tiles illuminated with two
                distinct shapes. Encapsulating negative and positive space. How do I feel? It was refreshing. Symmetry
                kept my eyes more up-down or right-left. It seems that this was made using one charette. On the gray
                motif, I’m drawn to see from the inside moving outwards. I feel this internalization of depth within my
                heart. I feel faced with something I don’t want to stare at for too long. I find myself jumping from
                black to black. I feel something unraveling in my heart. My chest. Pulling myself into different
                directions. Symmetry is beautiful but scary. Maybe it’s the choice of colours. Something about
                perfection seemed off-putting.

                As its sole purpose was to take up space, I find something within its pattern somewhat freeing. It was a
                pile of jumble. But I felt like I was that jumble. My eyes move across the pattern. I felt confused, but
                freeing. Almost like I can sense my energy flow between the crooks of rocks clashing into each other.
                Following in streams, I find myself going through a journey. A mixture of shapes, textures, and
                arrangements that collide together. Stimulating all places of my brain. I feel it pulsating. I feel
                maybe overstimulated by looking through its nooks and crannies, making me split my energy everywhere.

            <p>The edge of the buildings had a pattern of bricks arranged in a staircase. Normally, I wouldn’t bat an
                eye on this but right when I exited the vicinity, my foot felt the difference in height. I looked down,
                I felt a ding sensation.
                An alert!
                I stepped on uneven surfaces. Growing up, I hated the feeling of these bumps and edges on the sidewalks.
                It gave me such a disgusting feeling to feel something below my feet. The same I felt stepping on this.
                As I looked at the pattern as a whole, I saw a staircase arrangement framed with vertical bricks. My
                eyes were drawn by the flow of each line. Looking at it, I feel neutral. But following the lines felt

                radiating pattern reveals a depth of branches and simple splotches of red and orange that reminds me of
                autumn leaves. The frills coming out of the branch divided my attention, finding difficulty to focus on

                I spotted a plant behind my seat at the same restaurant. Leaves sprout in opposite directions. They are
                big at the beginning and slowly become smaller as I draw my focus to the tip. I feel my energy become
                sharper. Since the size of the leaves requires my eyes to view from big to small, my attention holds on
                a bit longer. I sense the familiarity and comfort of how relaxing I feel from feeling the ground up. It
                was a pleasant experience to look closely at. Perhaps nature was always connected to relaxation that
                influenced my perception.

                An interesting texture on a wall. I saw the metallic rust brown. It caught my eye. On the light that
                shines upon the embossed surface. I paid attention to the circle first. It points to a center. It is
                symmetrical and beautiful. I resonated deeply with the depth of colour, surface, and direction. I felt
                like I was facing something ethereal. Perhaps it’s the metallic shine. The grid structure gives a sense
                of stability. It overpowers, forcing my eyes to follow through. Little floral motifs added a touch of
                life in contrast to its material.

                Entering a bright orange cage, I noticed the black and white flower pot pattern on a window corner. It
                stood out as I found my eyes moving horizontally, focusing on the direction of the middle row. Geometric
                lines that go in zig zags created a playful atmosphere. I feel positive, up, and happy! I could imagine
                my heart beating in tune with the nature of these lines. It was a sandwich of conveyor belts. It felt
                like the pot was handmade with textured paints. The pattern brought out the fun in something that can be

                The gold colour struck me the most. On how bright, bold, and warm, it lured my eyes to look even
                closely. My eyes flicker between silver and gold. A repeated, complex motif. I felt positively
                stimulated. For the level of detail, I needed to stay longer to actually feel the pattern. It felt like
                an obstacle. My brain felt like solving a puzzle of its own. You would see one motif but there are two
                within the negative space. A discovery. So interesting and satisfying to find the difference. It was at
                the top of my head. A knot? A sensation that wrapped around my mind.

                This caught my eye walking to Richmond St.
                These rectangular motifs scattered with my eyes looking from bottom to top. One with the most density.
                An opaque window reflecting light, I was interested in how these shapes in its angle created
                perspective. In opposite directions, short to long rectangles, my eyes divert looking at zig-zag
                columns. The pattern added a sense of character to the window. Something like movement and life, I can’t
                look at how I look when I walk.

                The colour itself spoke out to me.
                Checkered red. Reminds me of a retro diner in the 90s. A classic and straight forward checkered pattern.
                I like it. Even with the brand’s aesthetic, it calls for fun and cheerfulness.
                A comic, racing, picnic.
                This checker can be used for many things I could think of. Viewing this aesthetically, my eyes divide
                when looking at its parts.
                As a whole, it looks like background noise.
                I can’t focus closely at all. Feels overstimulating. Reminds me of when you zoom in too close into a

                It is strong, structural, and bold. It demands my attention. Crystallized stars when viewing its forms

                From a whole selection/row of clothing, I instantly saw or even picked this black and white arrow

                to look from the ground up. I was captivated by the different techniques of each arrow. One seems to
                alternate between black and white. Others are filled with white. Specifically, the alternating shades, I

                I not buy it because of how others would perceive me?

                I don’t usually notice this but compared to my old shower curtain, this one was very frustrating to look
                at. Not only are the patterns scattered with shades of gray. I CAN’T SEE. It makes the shower appear so
                dark. How can I shower when I can’t see the shampoo and conditioner bottles!? It does look pretty
                though. I wish there was colour. It lacks liveliness. I find myself particularly interested. I see each
                square is repeated “randomly,” there is no order. Amongst finding that same motif, I keep track of one.
                The one I drew and this one here. It’s like I always end up finding these ones across the grid because
                they caught my attention. I feel they have a focal point that directs my eyes to instantly spot them.

                Free flowing lines remind me of the sand on the beach. The depth within the shadows allows easy

                The use of negative space for this divider decoration was really cool. I could see the window and

                patterns. It is simple, clean, and bold. I feel immersed in the bold gold hexagon. Lines connecting
                these hexagons demonstrates a level of intricacy and complexity. It gives me the room to breathe within
                my viewing experience. I felt whole.

                I captured the wall because I saw a glistening shine. The pattern is subtle and quiet. I silently try to
                examine these hexagons to its whole. I only could see a fragment because of the light that shines upon
                its surfaces. The wood surface follows parallel to the direction of the lines that enclose them. It’s
                illuminating. Shiny. Hexagons in hexagons. It is plain, but stands out due to its materiality. Wherever
                it shines, I go. I follow the light as I try to piece them together. If it was just the wood as a
                pattern, I would not have been intrigued. The thin shiny lines glowed so subtly.

                This is a Thai weaving pattern with the use of gold and red. Gold is often used in temple murals to
                dedicate the role of Buddha. I recently went on a trip to Thailand for a cultural exchange. It was
                amazing to relive the experience in this restaurant. The motif is a cultural motif and I perceive a
                shape of an elephant. However, it may be something else. Its texture imitates weaving patterns with
                abrupt rectangular rows. I feel a sense of importance, prestige, and an overwhelming pride of a cultural
                identity.

                I saw this pattern and thought I had to analyze this. I laughed when I immediately recognized the

                looked. I laughed. I thought it was amusing, playful, and innocent. Looking too much at it makes my head
                hurt though. I find my eyes scattered throughout in its simple duo colour palette. I often recognize
                these animal patterns for kids parties, which leads to this nostalgic feeling within me. I find it
                harder to focus on small prints versus big splotches. Almost like I’m zooming in.

                Immediately, I noticed the blue and white pattern! It was so familiar looking because my family owns
                Chinese porcelain clay vases. The pattern on the notebook is called Toile de Jouy. I researched this
                pattern before where it is the European’s interpretation of East Asian culture. As a whole, I thought it
                was an Asian pattern. Looking closely, it shows a narrative of everyday life. With nature, people and
                animals, it depicts a glimpse of freedom. To me, it is cherishing every little thing that surrounds me.
                I could breathe easily and find a natural flow (like a river) as I checked from one place to another.
                The amount of detail and cross-hatching textures brought out a level. In a sense, this brings a
                luxurious atmosphere of something “precious” and elegant. Perhaps, it is my cultural background that I
                see as a symbol of pride in my Chinese identity. That it is important and historical to me. It requires
                close attention. Especially when I see myself staying at one spot for a prolonged time.

                The table had white splashes in a chalk-like texture scattered across its surface.

                It reminded me of the untouched remains of spilt milk. Each splash was nerve-wracking to look at. It
                stimulates my head unpleasantly at the very top. I wonder why this cafe chose this as part of their
                interior design. I was very fixated and agitated by this messy sight. Every little mark on the table had
                my eyes twisting. I became so distracted and unorganized that I did not touch my work for 20 minutes. In
                the end, I constantly find myself trying to wipe something that isn’t there.

                After seeing the Toile De Jouy pattern at Staples, I thought I should capture my pottery at home. This

                whenever I see it. It gives me a sense of comfort and familiarity that I am in a Chinese-owned home.

                feel happy as my heart swirls. Almost as if the pattern itself helps embrace me and my identity. A big
                hug and appreciation to my cultural ethnicity.

                loved ones. I find myself in an infinite loop. I view the vines in a continuous cycle, in a circle, my

                What stood out to me the most was the overlapping foliage. Some green, blue, beige, and horizontal blue
                lines. The colour palette was unique and pleasant. It looks like there is a hierarchy amongst the
                colours. The blue pops out towards me. And then the beige is hiding in the white background. With so

                as a cohesive whole, it feels very explorative. I like it a lot. It is stimulating to look at and it’s
                fun to jump from one place to another. I feel a split attention. One side looking at the foreground
