        <div class="description">
            <p> This blog comprises journal entries based on my experience with everyday patterns. My thesis hopes
                to
                investigate the psychological affinity and emotional effects of patterns on humans. By doing so, I
                use
                psychological strategies such as attention and emotional theories, Cannon-Bard and James Lange's.
                <br>
                <br>
                This consistent repetition of photographing, sketching, and reflecting allowed me to discover
                alternative
                ways to look at patterns and myself. This process interests different perspectives we superimpose on
                designed artifacts and how creating/selecting describes us. As such, design is a cycle of
                repetition,
                like
                patterns.

            <p>So many swirls that makes it busy looking.
                The colour brown or beige makes it dull. Why?
                Maybe it’s because of the same tone that is not contrasting enough. The dark versus light shades are
                different. The swirls fill up the space, making it overstimulated. Feels my energy spread throughout
                the
                chest area. A swirly florally like pattern of vines in brown and beige combo similar to ink
                blotches. I
                feel this tension within my chest. Anxious, lost on where to look. I feel my eyes going up and down.
                The
                little details of the brush makes me feel super itchy. It seems outdated and ancient. It captures
                the
                maximalist carpet look.

                my room where I sleep? Breathable with white space to digest. Feelings come from the head. Focus is on
                one spot which is at the flowers. I feel warmth within the colours. My eye changes, hopping around from
                one place to another. I feel an unfolding sensation, the water colours send a chilling feeling. I find
                the water colours to be relaxing and raw in nature. It is authentic and incomplete but the texture and
                spacing is cold and sparse. </p>

            <p>Mesmerized by the spacing and contrast in the pattern. I zone out within the space. I felt calm and
                centered, looking at the middle. Almost like I am contained and united in this circle and grid
                structure. The colour was brown and beige, giving a warm and cozy sensation. It is a flat 2D surface,
                with nothing more to look into, like a wall.

            <p>It was a wood arrangement piece.
                Walking into the Chinese buffet, I felt my energy at low. The atmosphere of the location did not excite
                my anticipation for food. It was a dull and outdated design that is darkly lit, almost abandoned. The
                strokes on the wood interlocking with different shades of brown resembles burnt firewood. Captured this
                pattern within my position. It establishes a cultural touch with Chinese heritage. Red is an important
                colour for luck and prosperity. The wooden materiality, I would assume, has a raw authenticity of
                China’s upbringing. The random strokes of lines caught me off guard. While the wooden logs are organized
                in a grid, its contents add a layer of texture. I feel a bit conflicted. My eyes move up, right, down,
                left. Looping in a circle. Disrupting flow to shift in different directions. Mismatched coloration,
                random holes. As a whole, it intrigues my mind. A pattern is ordered but the wood’s graining is
                randomized. The holes, I wonder what are they for? But their addition led me to feel like I’m going in
                circles. Like I am stuck in a loop, with these little holes that will soon turn into bigger problems.
                Unstable was the feeling. </p>

                Walking in, I felt welcomed and enticed with the space. These repeated floor tiles illuminated with two
                distinct shapes. Encapsulating negative and positive space. How do I feel? It was refreshing. Symmetry
                kept my eyes more up-down or right-left. It seems that this was made using one charette. On the gray
                motif, I’m drawn to see from the inside moving outwards. I feel this internalization of depth within my
                heart. I feel faced with something I don’t want to stare at for too long. I find myself jumping from
                black to black. I feel something unraveling in my heart. My chest. Pulling myself into different
                directions. Symmetry is beautiful but scary. Maybe it’s the choice of colours. Something about
                perfection seemed off-putting.

            <p>I spotted a pile of rocks.
                As its sole purpose was to take up space, I find something within its pattern somewhat freeing. It was a
                pile of jumble. But I felt like I was that jumble. My eyes move across the pattern. I felt confused, but
                freeing. Almost like I can sense my energy flow between the crooks of rocks clashing into each other.
                Following in streams, I find myself going through a journey. A mixture of shapes, textures, and
                arrangements that collide together. Stimulating all places of my brain. I feel it pulsating. I feel
                maybe overstimulated by looking through its nooks and crannies, making me split my energy everywhere.

            <p>The edge of the buildings had a pattern of bricks arranged in a staircase. Normally, I wouldn’t bat an
                eye on this but right when I exited the vicinity, my foot felt the difference in height. I looked down,
                I felt a ding sensation.
                An alert!
                I stepped on uneven surfaces. Growing up, I hated the feeling of these bumps and edges on the sidewalks.
                It gave me such a disgusting feeling to feel something below my feet. The same I felt stepping on this.
                As I looked at the pattern as a whole, I saw a staircase arrangement framed with vertical bricks. My
                eyes were drawn by the flow of each line. Looking at it, I feel neutral. But following the lines felt
                like shifting my energy from my chest to my head or down to my chest. </p>

            <p> Enamored by the illuminated warmth of yellow, I gravitated towards the lantern like a moth. The
                radiating pattern reveals a depth of branches and simple splotches of red and orange that reminds me of
                autumn leaves. The frills coming out of the branch divided my attention, finding difficulty to focus on
                the little details. My eyes bounce from splotch to splotch. It was a mix of overstimulation and skipping
                stones with simplicity.

                I spotted a plant behind my seat at the same restaurant. Leaves sprout in opposite directions. They are
                big at the beginning and slowly become smaller as I draw my focus to the tip. I feel my energy become
                sharper. Since the size of the leaves requires my eyes to view from big to small, my attention holds on
                a bit longer. I sense the familiarity and comfort of how relaxing I feel from feeling the ground up. It
                was a pleasant experience to look closely at. Perhaps nature was always connected to relaxation that
                influenced my perception.

                An interesting texture on a wall. I saw the metallic rust brown. It caught my eye. On the light that
                shines upon the embossed surface. I paid attention to the circle first. It points to a center. It is
                symmetrical and beautiful. I resonated deeply with the depth of colour, surface, and direction. I felt
                like I was facing something ethereal. Perhaps it’s the metallic shine. The grid structure gives a sense
                of stability. It overpowers, forcing my eyes to follow through. Little floral motifs added a touch of
                life in contrast to its material.
                It was inviting and warm.

                Entering a bright orange cage, I noticed the black and white flower pot pattern on a window corner. It
                stood out as I found my eyes moving horizontally, focusing on the direction of the middle row. Geometric
                lines that go in zig zags created a playful atmosphere. I feel positive, up, and happy! I could imagine
                my heart beating in tune with the nature of these lines. It was a sandwich of conveyor belts. It felt
                like the pot was handmade with textured paints. The pattern brought out the fun in something that can be
                hand-made.

                The gold colour struck me the most. On how bright, bold, and warm, it lured my eyes to look even
                closely. My eyes flicker between silver and gold. A repeated, complex motif. I felt positively
                stimulated. For the level of detail, I needed to stay longer to actually feel the pattern. It felt like
                an obstacle. My brain felt like solving a puzzle of its own. You would see one motif but there are two
                within the negative space. A discovery. So interesting and satisfying to find the difference. It was at
                the top of my head. A knot? A sensation that wrapped around my mind.

                see bright yellow bulging out of the green exterior. Glossy and ordered within columns, I find my eyes
                following a vertical direction. I felt the urge to pop or touch these little balls!

                Calm and intrigued, I spent a short time looking.

                This caught my eye walking to Richmond St.
                These rectangular motifs scattered with my eyes looking from bottom to top. One with the most density.
                An opaque window reflecting light, I was interested in how these shapes in its angle created
                perspective. In opposite directions, short to long rectangles, my eyes divert looking at zig-zag
                columns. The pattern added a sense of character to the window. Something like movement and life, I can’t
                look at how I look when I walk.

                Why rain?
                I stared at the blank concrete canvas. Droplets fall from the sky. My eyes shift as I watch where each
                landed. I felt so engaged and almost meditative to focus on this act. Overall, it was a soothing
                experience. The pattern became small to a whole entity. Engulfed by its perpetrator. I sensed
                fulfillment and a deep sensation of sentiment in my heart. Perhaps rainy days aren’t the best memories I
                had. It was mind-opening to see new forms unveiled in front of me.

                The colour itself spoke out to me.
                Checkered red. Reminds me of a retro diner in the 90s. A classic and straight forward checkered pattern.
                I like it. Even with the brand’s aesthetic, it calls for fun and cheerfulness.
                A comic, racing, picnic.
                This checker can be used for many things I could think of. Viewing this aesthetically, my eyes divide
                when looking at its parts.
                As a whole, it looks like background noise.
                I can’t focus closely at all. Feels overstimulating. Reminds me of when you zoom in too close into a
                Photoshop file, it gets blurry and pixelated.

                Out of all the patterns on this Japanese sticker sheet, the geometric ones stood out the most to me.
                Why?
                It is strong, structural, and bold. It demands my attention. Crystallized stars when viewing its forms
                reveal other forms from negative space when shapes are closer together. Layer upon layer. This is
                infinity. My eyes are drowned with endless possibilities. There are x and y planes going in 2
                directions. I find myself jumping from the centers of each shape.

                From a whole selection/row of clothing, I instantly saw or even picked this black and white arrow
                pattern. I loved the colours. I’ve been wanting a sweater with a touch of knitting. These arrows led me
                to look from the ground up. I was captivated by the different techniques of each arrow. One seems to
                alternate between black and white. Others are filled with white. Specifically, the alternating shades, I
                was strongly engaged within. Stimulating with awe, it brings out another dimension, another layer. I
                felt intrigued but I thought I wouldn’t know how to style the sweater, so I put it back on the rack. Did
                I not buy it because of how others would perceive me?

                I don’t usually notice this but compared to my old shower curtain, this one was very frustrating to look
                at. Not only are the patterns scattered with shades of gray. I CAN’T SEE. It makes the shower appear so
                dark. How can I shower when I can’t see the shampoo and conditioner bottles!? It does look pretty
                though. I wish there was colour. It lacks liveliness. I find myself particularly interested. I see each
                square is repeated “randomly,” there is no order. Amongst finding that same motif, I keep track of one.
                The one I drew and this one here. It’s like I always end up finding these ones across the grid because
                they caught my attention. I feel they have a focal point that directs my eyes to instantly spot them.

                Free flowing lines remind me of the sand on the beach. The depth within the shadows allows easy

                follows through each rhythm unconsciously. I feel my brain aching. Throbbing. I am mesmerized by such
                simplicity.

                The use of negative space for this divider decoration was really cool. I could see the window and
                background in the holes. Although, the pattern itself evoked an “oriental” pattern. Similar to Japanese
                patterns. It is simple, clean, and bold. I feel immersed in the bold gold hexagon. Lines connecting
                these hexagons demonstrates a level of intricacy and complexity. It gives me the room to breathe within
                my viewing experience. I felt whole.

                This might not be a pattern but it was really electrifying to see these lines on my way to the Go Bus

                height between the lines.

                I captured the wall because I saw a glistening shine. The pattern is subtle and quiet. I silently try to
                examine these hexagons to its whole. I only could see a fragment because of the light that shines upon
                its surfaces. The wood surface follows parallel to the direction of the lines that enclose them. It’s
                illuminating. Shiny. Hexagons in hexagons. It is plain, but stands out due to its materiality. Wherever
                it shines, I go. I follow the light as I try to piece them together. If it was just the wood as a
                pattern, I would not have been intrigued. The thin shiny lines glowed so subtly.

                Another use of hexagons grouped in a honeycomb composition. North, south, east, west black hexagons
                surrounding the white space. My eyes look at the big blob of white space. Feeling nothing. Literally
                nothing. Just stuck in space. When lost in space, I see the black hexagons come forward into my vision.
                Blurred. Only they can clear the lines between the white hexagons.

                Out of all the patterns that are overlapping one another, I particularly found this one to be most

                flower motifs. Refreshing to look at in the city area. Not too loud. Mesmerizing qualities of space.
                Elegant that says “do not touch.” Eye direction to follow each swirl.

                This is a Thai weaving pattern with the use of gold and red. Gold is often used in temple murals to
                dedicate the role of Buddha. I recently went on a trip to Thailand for a cultural exchange. It was
                amazing to relive the experience in this restaurant. The motif is a cultural motif and I perceive a
                shape of an elephant. However, it may be something else. Its texture imitates weaving patterns with
                abrupt rectangular rows. I feel a sense of importance, prestige, and an overwhelming pride of a
                cultural
                identity.

                I saw this pattern and thought I had to analyze this. I laughed when I recognized the

                hurt though. I find my eyes scattered throughout in its simple duo colour palette. I often recognize
                these animal patterns for kids parties, which leads to this nostalgic feeling within me. I find it
                harder to focus on small prints versus big splotches. Almost like I’m zooming in.

                Immediately, I noticed the blue and white pattern! It was so familiar looking because my family owns
                Chinese porcelain clay vases. The pattern on the notebook is called Toile de Jouy. I researched this
                pattern before where it is the European’s interpretation of East Asian culture. As a whole, I
                thought it
                was an Asian pattern. Looking closely, it shows a narrative of everyday life. With nature, people
                and
                animals, it depicts a glimpse of freedom. To me, it is cherishing every little thing that surrounds
                me.
                I could breathe easily and find a natural flow (like a river) as I checked from one place to
                another.
                The amount of detail and cross-hatching textures brought out a level. In a sense, this brings a
                luxurious atmosphere of something “precious” and elegant. Perhaps, it is my cultural background that
                I
                see as a symbol of pride in my Chinese identity. That it is important and historical to me. It
                requires
                close attention. Especially when I see myself staying at one spot for a prolonged time.

                The table had white splashes in a chalk-like texture scattered across its surface. 
                It was very messy and unappealing. 
                It reminded me of the untouched remains of spilt milk. Each splash was nerve-wracking to look at. It
                stimulates my head unpleasantly at the very top. I wonder why this cafe chose this as part of their
                interior design. I was very fixated and agitated by this messy sight. Every little mark on the table
                had
                my eyes twisting. I became so distracted and unorganized that I did not touch my work for 20

                After seeing the Toile De Jouy pattern at Staples, I thought I should capture my pottery at home.
                This
                is what I see everyday when I enter the living room. It is so familiar. I would know I am at home
                whenever I see it. It gives me a sense of comfort and familiarity that I am in a Chinese-owned home.
                Often overlooked, I examine closely this time to see how I feel when staring closely into the vines.
                I
                feel happy as my heart swirls. Almost as if the pattern itself helps embrace me and my identity. A
                big
                hug and appreciation to my cultural ethnicity.

                This pattern is so iconic!
                Especially in Dim sum restaurants. If I see this pattern separately by itself, I would automatically
                recognize it is for Dim Sum places. Under the light, the swirls shine the brightest. It is spacious
                and
                intentional through its stroke weight. It is overlooked by many but it adds a natural and organic
                appeal. Dim sum is shared amongst family. The fabric seems to connect everyone together with food
                placed
                on top. It brings me warmth and happiness. It completes the overall experience of sharing food with
                loved ones. I find myself in an infinite loop. I view the vines in a continuous cycle, in a circle,
                my
                eyes not stopping to take a break.

                What stood out to me the most was the overlapping foliage. Some green, blue, beige, and horizontal
                blue
                lines. The colour palette was unique and pleasant. It looks like there is a hierarchy amongst the
                colours. The blue pops out towards me. And then the beige is hiding in the white background. With so
                many different types of elements and textures, I find the pattern pleasant. I can’t look into detail
                but
                as a cohesive whole, it feels very explorative. I like it a lot. It is stimulating to look at and
                it’s
                fun to jump from one place to another. I feel a split attention. One side looking at the foreground
                while feeling the buzzy noise in the background.

                The carpet looked like a horrific disaster. It was like witnessing an actual crime scene. The
                victim’s
                blood was leaking and staining the entire carpet. The vibrant red attracted my attention like a
                curious
                hummingbird. Staring deeply into the pattern, its materiality simulating weaving attributes makes
                the
                entire piece look glitchy and distorted. I sense a level of confusion and frustration within myself.
                The
                little grainy texture makes me squeamish. If I look for too long, I will vomit. A physical sensation

                From these forms alone, I felt like I was in Antarctica. The use of blue to gray colour palette
                evoked
                the chilly atmosphere of the North pole. I find this pattern to be calming, as if I was taking a
                stroll.
                I allowed this path to lead me wherever it takes me. I see a majority of blues, my eyes avoiding to
                meet
                the gray platform. I felt at peace studying in this space. I was satisfied and grateful to have
                found a
                place like this. I feel that I process light colours more easily, than a deeper and darker colour
                that
                requires time for contemplation. As a whole, I feel my energy dispersing into many avenues. Almost
                like
                it’s leaking out. All I can say is, “this is what going with the flow” would look and feel like.

                One glance and I knew I had to take a picture of this pattern! Although it lacks colour, the shapes
                and
                forms truly brought out this sensation of attachment for me. The layering of circles added an
                element of
                surprise as I see star shapes coming out of the negative space. The simple pattern is so mesmerizing
                to
                look at. It gave off a touch of elegance with its transparent parts to reveal the stores’ interior.
                It
                was inviting to look at. It was friendly and fun. My eyes stare in the direction of the columns. It
                was
                easy to process with fluid and smooth movements.

                These dots in a grid structure reminded me a lot of street tactile pavings. It works well
                functionally
                and aesthetically, delivering an industrial mood. The space was cozy and warm. A small, retro spot
                to
                eat in a dark autumn afternoon. The pattern evoked nostalgia for me. Perhaps the weather had some
                influence, but I feel like I’m reliving my childhood. The bright outlines of circles popped out to
                my
                attention and immediately I was playing a game of connecting the dots. It was fascinating to reflect
                how
                I jump from places and ignore the brown circles in the background. I thought this exercise was fun
                and

                Reviewing its composition, this pattern is the embodiment of nausea. The mixture of blues and a hint of
                sage green created a mushy, stomach-churning experience. These stitches were unpredictable, the
                embodiment of randomness. This overwhelming sensation made it difficult for me to look at the details
                closely for a prolonged duration. I feel my body refraining and rejecting my desire to make sense of the
                random colours in a chain. The pixelated stitches provoked a stippling or ticking pulse in my head as I
                refused to wrap in the nauseating texture.

                As I quickly scurried home, I couldn’t help noticing a lady with a lovely coat in bright magenta
                floral prints. The flowers bloomed elegantly within its container. I can imagine they were too
                precious to touch. There was a boundary on how far we could look from or feel its presence with its
                square border. I particularly admired the vibrant colours that reflected a sunset beach, with navy
                blues, oranges, and magentas. The pattern itself was visually complex, dynamic, and exciting to look
                at. It didn’t just look like a flat surface. I was excited and happy to find such an expressive
                pattern in this mundane city drowned in shades of grey. It was a tiring day, but I felt rejuvenated
                after witnessing this bright pattern. You could say I felt like a mosquito attracted to light as I
                walked behind the lady who travels in the same path as me.

                Such subtle geometric shapes rotate as I run my eyes across each row. I felt pleasant with a variety of

                Quiet and symmetrical, the lines of this pattern created balance. They direct to a focal point in rows
                of zig-zags wrapping around the pole. It was structural and 3-dimensional, reinforcing the pole’s
                characteristics of stability and reliability.

                It was fascinating to see how the interplay of light and shadow created depth and guided my eyes. A
                repeated number of lines forces our eyes to follow through, making it hard to break through its command.
                I instinctively followed the lines as if it were a natural response. It reminds me of habits and neuron
                pathways where the brain enjoys taking shortcuts and easy outs.

                I always stare at the middle, where the lines are dense and meet each other with fewer gaps. When
                following these trails, my breathing relaxingly adjusted. My diaphragm expands and contracts as if I’m
                walking peacefully through a park. I imagine it would be a great meditation exercise since it was
                therapeutic.

                These tiles repeat across the grid. A black background highlights the bright oranges to pop out, leaving
                a bold and clean impression when crossing the streets. I saw the flower shape motif first. Then I
                noticed the X’s spread across diagonally. Depending on where you focus, this pattern offers many
                perspectives of shapes. I felt like I was playing a game, having fun finding different shapes pop out as
                I shifted focus to many negative spaces. The pattern gave a sense of stability, providing Paramount’s
                brand image seemed consistent in services or food. Replicating the pattern was challenging because of
                its intricate motif, with many closely connected elements.

                The geometrical triangles lined up in a grid, sharp and dynamic. Somehow, I felt perplexed by how
                divided my attention was as my eyes separated, as they couldn’t agree to look at which side. Somehow,
                the pattern enabled me to use my right side more.

                I feel a sensation on the right side of my head as I stare deeply, weighing heavily on my head. The
                contradicting shapes and colours cause confusion and signs of disturbance. It was a rigid and disrupted
                flow. Moreover, looking diagonally at the top-right to the left-down dispels my worries. It was smooth
                and satisfying. I find myself in the middle of a dilemma. As I stayed for a while, I saw check mark
                shapes sideways that resonated with overlapping brain waves. It was more interesting to witness. It
                created another dimension of a spiral staircase with a sharp geometric pattern on a round cup.

                While shopping for clothes with my mom, I was drawn to a stitched pattern on a sweater. It looked
                familiar, like something I had seen elsewhere, and I loved its aesthetic. I thought this was something I
                would buy and truly identify with. It had a simple black-and-white palette with four rows of distinct
                forms and shapes.

                Each row had its own repeated motif—one with an X-mark, another with hexagons, and one with fire-like
                flames. The sweater felt at home, wrapped in a cozy blanket on a freezing day. The patterns enveloped
                me, and I felt uplifted. My complexion seemed to brighten, just like the sweater, filling me with
                confidence. I loved seeing the intricate details and the strips of repeated motifs. My attention
                sharpened, drawn to each characteristic, deepening my appreciation for the pattern.

                A ceramic bowl with vibrant navy blue floral spiralling vines filled my entire vision. The weight of the
                vine strokes felt dense, while the petals appeared soft and squishable. The bowl itself felt fragile and
                delicate, yet the bold pattern gave it an illusion of heaviness. An intrusive thought crossed my mind.
                These thick vines looked as if they could strangle me.

                My eyes followed the winding trails of the vines, only to reach abrupt dead ends. I kept tracing,
                searching for the longest continuous path. My gaze spiralled, and when I finally reached the end, a
                sense of satisfaction washed over me. I felt joy as if I were spinning within the bowl itself.

                The pattern had a playful, human touch, with its opaque brushstrokes and handmade imperfections. Each
                petal varied in size, deepening my appreciation for ceramics.

                I was in a room filled with constant noise—a pool of countless shapes and shades of gray. I was
                paralyzed, engulfed by a swarm of static. I could only observe in the present.

                It was cold, silent, and motionless. I couldn’t move or break free from the experience. It felt like
                something meant to be absorbed as a whole at once. My mind refused to drift away from the center. It was
                like looking through a microscope, where microorganisms demanded my full attention, prolonging the
                moment. Yet, despite my focus, I couldn’t make sense of the composition.

                The carpet featured diagonal motifs, mirrored and stacked in a bold, zigzagging pattern. The blocks
                layered on each other, creating a striking and dynamic visual statement.

                Its design felt continuous, with an embossed texture that stood out. Structurally, it was
                intricate—twisted, tangled, and knotted together in an almost chaotic rhythm.

                I found myself mentally tracing the lines, trying to decipher their paths. It was an engaging yet
                draining puzzle. The overlapping forms reminded me of tangled cable cords lying in an interwoven mess.

                Octagons repeat beside each other in a grid with pearl-marbled stone. The texture has a smooth finish
                with ripples of the marble itself. In addition to the outline, it reminds me of ice cream chocolate
                glaze. I would eat this pattern because it looks like it would taste sweet and delicious. As the
                octagons stack together, a small diagonal square surprises me. Without intending to, the pattern created
                a new shape to emerge. The outline stands out amazingly!

                My friend’s woven hat felt rough. The fabric was thin and itchy, possibly worn down from prolonged use.
                Despite this, it seemed like it would be warm to wear.

                The braided pattern created a strong, interlocking structure that helped retain heat. Its crisscross
                motion was visually pleasing, adding a sense of rhythm to the design. I examined the crevices where the
                braids intersected and wondered what could be inside. Could there be dirt, dust, or even a little bug?
                The pattern stands out as a rich, textural piece. However, I did not enjoy the feel of the material—its
                fuzzy texture was unpleasant against my skin.

                This floor pattern was dark and simple. I felt myself drowning, the lines above trapping me under like a
                fish caught in the ocean. The lines change unpredictably. The sight of looking or even finding the motif
                was confusing. I refused to locate a commonality in the pattern and appreciated its overall look. I
                suddenly have a tendency to object to anything that looks difficult. My brain does like to have
                shortcuts. The composition was confusing, making it hard to find a pattern in the pattern. Thus evoking
                me to feel nauseous. My brain itches. My tummy squirms. It was a pleasant whole and a not-so-pleasant

                I gazed at a beautiful green and white plaid skirt with envy. My first thought was, it’s so pretty. I
                wanted one for myself.

                As I looked closer, a sense of calm washed over me. The perpendicular lines overlapped in intricate
                repetitions of squares, creating a pattern that felt both structured and soothing. The combination of
                lace and stitched textures, along with its simple two-colour palette, added depth to its design. My eyes
                moved horizontally and vertically, tracing each intersection, bringing quiet comfort to my soul as I

                A jolly time of the year! Seeing Christmas patterns and the repetitive use of snowmen, trees, and more

                This pattern inspires me to create more. Its symmetrical balance and harmonious blend of shapes ripple

                I felt it was necessary to add Andy Warhol’s Campbell’s Soup Cans as he repeats an item (with different
                labels) in a grid. His use of repetition reveals why humans like patterns. As an iconic and historical
                piece, the message of repetition displays consumerism and media saturation. With so much noise in the
                world to advertise a product and say a ‘catchphrase,’ the human brain will grow familiar and attracted
                with time. The art piece creates conversations about societal norms and consumerism, revealing how
                powerful patterns are to enforce immediacy and importance.

                The repetitive zigzag lines drawn with a Sharpie created a bold, dynamic, and playful statement. The
                graphic exuded energy, inviting experimentation with different forms. Despite its monochromatic grey
                palette, I was drawn more to the movement and structure than the colour itself. The thick lines ask for
                my attention, almost confronting me directly. Strangely, this pattern sparked an unexpected surge of
                energy—an urge to punch something or engage in a physical activity.

                This packaging design has interlocking elements that convey a sense of stability and strength. The warm
                hues of yellow and brown evoke feelings of comfort and hospitality. However, the intersecting diagonals
                disrupt the flow, creating a sense of tension. There’s an intriguing dimensionality in how the lines
                pass through circles, adding complexity to the design. Since this pattern is tied to branding and
                consumerism, I was conflicted. Looking visually appealing, I can’t shake the feeling of being deceived.

                I picked a floral print to create a scrunchie, a mini sewing project. I thought it was such a pretty

                including organic and natural elements that bring warmth I feel from the outside. I can feel myself
                lying under an abundance of flowers on a spring day. I first focus on the little details and appreciate

                Triangular rows repeat one after another. I feel the colours are dull and desaturated from their vibrant
                hue. I would associate feeling bored with this exact pattern. Not much is intriguing as it reflects on a
                2D surface with no hidden shapes revealed from close forms together. As this is on a cloth, I feel the
                low quality of the pattern makes it easier to use the cloth as an object to dispose of.

                I recognize the Japanese pattern Seigaiha, which is repeating semi-circles overlapping in rows. They
                signify waves in Japanese design. This one uses dots to shape their waves. Discontinuous lines are

                The use of bows is repeatedly associated with the popular ‘coquette’ aesthetic, where this generation
                strives off of different identities of aesthetics. It romanticizes the Victorian period, bringing lace,
                pink/pastel colours, and more in outfits. I loved the trend and embraced things I found feminine. The
                repeated use and categorizations of aesthetics encourage people to identify with it. It is what makes
                habits desirable when you want to become something you want others to see you as. The pattern is
                identity. The shine is ethereal and reminds me of hair. It is a pretty object that prompts an immediate
                reaction to saying, “Cute!”

                This wood-carved motif was astonishing. The technical precision of the relief, along with the smooth,
                flowing curves, made it truly special. I was most drawn to the center, where the leaves repeated
                radially, creating a mesmerizing focal point. The ornamental, whimsical details of the leaves reminded
                me of Art Nouveau’s core characteristics: graceful, organic, and expressive. I’ve always admired how Art
                Nouveau patterns bring character and appreciation to art, and this piece was nothing short of divine.

                I took pictures of the clothes I would buy. Most of the spring collection featured 2D flat
                patterns—pretty designs that offered a glimpse into this season’s trends: florals, pastels, and light
                fabrics. Patterns in clothing add layers and dimension, transforming fabric into a canvas of expression.
                I love seeing people style their outfits, mixing colours with different textures. As flowers bloom in
                spring, floral motifs mark the season’s return, a natural rhythm reflected through fashion.

                A bull/cow motif decorated with flowers glare towards my direction. I felt alert, yet fascinated by the

                vivid reds with notes of blues and pinks. I feel its powerful and charismatic presence from its eyes as
                the colours stand boldly.

                A couple of mugs were decorated with detailed blue swirls and small motifs, seemingly inspired by
                Chinese porcelain designs. I feel a bit overwhelmed by the energy and noise created when details are

                more open space.

                My eyes are drawn to the center of this one cup. I could breathe freely and rest from admiring the
                intricate details. It resembled a snowflake, evoking memories of winter, which is now melted away.

                Beautiful tiles of flowers in various orientations and colours. The black connects everything together.
                It is strong and captures my initial attention. I appreciate the red and beige adding that organic,
                natural atmosphere to the area. Looking closely at the single-coloured motif, I see a black border
                surrounding it as the focal point. With a dusty texture, I feel enlightened and grounded with the

                Bamboo straws overlap, forming an octagonal-hole pattern. I was ecstatic to see these textures
                intertwine. It seems unlikely that a machine could create this; I imagine the creator thoughtfully
                considering which strand should rest atop the other.

                With multiple layers and a careful balance of negative space, I feel a weight lifted from my shoulders.
                The delicate strands intertwining evoke notes of happiness that burst like floating bubbles. I do not

                The tile contains a mix of curves and straight lines. The colour palette had hints of earth tones such

                feelings. The leaves point towards the middle, guiding my eyes to look there initially. I felt secure

                The bright orange pops out across from the plastic bag. It intrigues me. I was happy approaching such a
                detailed pattern. The repeated use of white lines formed into leaves gives texture and dimension to the
                abundance of nature. It was organic and light. Within my chest, I was fluffy and giddy, hopping in joy.

                This pattern tickles my brain in a good way! The mat was inviting me to step on it with simple rows of
                white and greys on the bathroom mat. The little fluffy dots were comfortable under my feet. I started to
                wonder how it felt to touch the different colours. One felt heavier than the other. I understand they
                were made of the same material, but my brain makes its assumption.

                Even fences are patterns, too! The metal wires intertwine, building a protective space, marking the area
                that “thou shall not pass!” I thought it would be easy to climb over, but others would be able to see
                me. It was hard to focus on the pattern. The background filled up my vision—almost so that it was meant
                to be hidden. I find myself </p>

                The chair in the lobby had such a dynamic pattern. The diagonal lines were the first thing my eyes
                followed. There were black columns weaved in to create a halftone effect. Viewing too closely can be
                dangerous as I find myself confused. I was astonished by the textures that change when you walk around
                the chair at different angles. It scratches my brain, making me a bit anxious.

                The red and navy blue pattern reminded me of a rose bush. The vibrant red roses shine bright under the
                sunlight. They looked beautiful and complex with various shapes and sizes. I wanted to pick one up and
                smell them. Although that sounds awful if I did it on the TTC bus… Subtle dark reds points to depth and
                layers on the pattern. I enjoyed looking from afar.
