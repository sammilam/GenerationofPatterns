        <div class="description">
            <p> This blog comprises journal entries based on my experience with everyday patterns. My thesis hopes
                to
                investigate the psychological affinity and emotional effects of patterns on humans. By doing so, I
                use
                psychological strategies such as attention and emotional theories, Cannon-Bard and James Lange's.
                <br>
                <br>
                This consistent repetition of photographing, sketching, and reflecting allowed me to discover
                alternative
                ways to look at patterns and myself. This process interests different perspectives we superimpose on
                designed artifacts and how creating/selecting describes us. As such, design is a cycle of
                repetition,
                like
                patterns.

                <p> So many swirls that makes it busy looking
                    The colour brown or beige makes it dull why?
                    Maybe itâ€™s because of the same tone that is not contrasting enough.
                    The dark versus light shades are different.
                    The swirls fill up the space, making it overstimulated.
                    I feel my energy spread throughout the chest area.
                    A swirly florally like pattern of vines in brown and beige combo similar to ink blotches
                    I feel this tension within my chest.
                    Anxious, lost on where to look.
                    I feel my eyes going up and down.
                    The little details of the brush makes me feel super itchy.
                    It seems outdated and ancient. It captures the maximalist carpet look.

                    Flower prints bloom, spread out, water-colours, 3 block colour: orange, white, green, and lots of
                    white space.
                    My initial feelings were relaxed?
                    Because of the pattern or is it because it is in the context of my room where I sleep?
                    Breathable with white space to digest.
                    Feelings come from the head.
                    Focus is on one spot which is at the flowers.
                    I feel warmth within the colours.
                    My eye changes, hopping around from one place to another.
                    I feel an unfolding sensation, the water colours send a chilling feeling.
                    I find the water colours to be relaxing and raw in nature.
                    It is authentic and incomplete but the texture and spacing is cold and sparse.

                <p> Mesmerized by the spacing and contrast in the pattern.
                    I zone out within the space.
                    I felt calm and centered, looking at the middle.
                    Almost like I am contained and united in this circle and grid structure.
                    The colour was brown and beige, giving a warm and cozy sensation.
                    It is a flat 2D surface, with nothing more to look into, like a wall.
